# vector

# sort
As with the time complexity, the space complexity of the sorting
method used can vary from language to language. C++'s STL, for example,
uses QuickSort most of the time but will switch to either HeapSort or 
InsertionSort depending on the nature of the data. 
- Java uses a variant of QuickSort with dual pivots when dealing with arrays of primitive values.
- The implementation of both C++'s and Java's sort methods will require an 
average of O(\log N)O(logN) extra space. 
- Python, on the other hand, uses TimSort, which is a hybrid of MergeSort and InsertionSort and requires 
O(N)O(N) extra space. Unlike most other languages, Javascript's sort method 
will actually vary from browser to browser. Since the adoption of ECMAScript 2019, 
however, the sort method is required to be stable, which generally means MergeSort 
or TimSort and a space complexity of O(N)O(N).

# set
- have unique vales stored in sorted order
- values are immutable
- follows Binary search tree implementation
- vlaues in a set are unindexeds
- insertion, deletion time complexity - O(logN)

# multiset
- insertion, acessing, deleting O(logN)
- clear O(N)
- size O(1)

# unordered_set
- implemented using a hash table where keys are hashed into idices 
  of a hash table so that insertion is always randomized
- All operations on the unordered_set tales constant time O(1)
  on an average which can go up to linear time O(N).

# map 
- implementation is done using self balancing BST like Red-Black tree
- search time log(N)
- insertion, deletion time: O(logN) + Rebalance

# unordered_map
- implementation is done using Hash Table
search, insertion, deletion time:
- average O(1)
- Worst case O(N)

# priority queue
- By default top element is always the greatest element (max-heap)
- constant time extraction of the largest element, at expense of logarithmic insertion
- push, pop O(logN)
- top O(1)

# heap 
- heap is a data structure that has the form of a tree and that respects 
the heap property, namely: every node must be lower than each of its children
